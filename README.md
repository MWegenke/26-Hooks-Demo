# Hook a list of Pokemon

Her is a basic fully functional application. 
It was created using React Hooks. 
There are instructions throughout the js files, as well as stretch goals at the end of App.js

Use the Learn content, and internet, to complete tasks.
Once all tasks are complete, including stretch goals, put your own spin on this application or see if you can replicate what is created here without looking at the completed application. 

Refactor any tags that contain embedded CSS, rather use the .css file.

Have fun and Learn something. Remember Slack is always open to ask questions.
